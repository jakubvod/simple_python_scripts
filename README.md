# python_scripts
**❗FOR LEARNING PURPOSES❗**
- Small and simple Python scripts I wrote while learning and refreshing my skills.
- These are just practice projects to explore libraries and concepts like filesystem handling or API usage.
## 📂 SUFFIX READER - Reads all suffixes in a directory (with optional filtering). The script must be placed inside the target directory.
**Skills used:**
- Working with the file system using pathlib.
- Handling user input.
## 🎵 SPOTIPY SCRIPT - Given an artist input, the script randomly plays one of their 10 most popular songs (Spotify premium required).
**Skills used:**
- Managing sensitive data with ".env" and ".gitignore".
- Working with Spotipy and OAuth.
